# Deep-dream

Deep dream is a computer vision technique designed by Google engineers to imitate dream-like hallucinations using overlapping of image with convolutional filters.
Basically the idea is to obtain results of intermediate hidden layers from pre-trained models and differentiate them to maximize the loss to excite the layers thus producing enhanced filters.
